Getting started
=========================================================================================

If you're a researcher currently running online studies and interested in joining the new
improved Children Helping Science to run your own developmental studies, here's how you 
get started!

Join the Slack workspace!
----------------------------

Please `fill out this form <https://forms.gle/WVapAncBwRPR7pLX9>`__ for
an invite.

Slack is our primary means of communication about new features, best
practices, etc. It’s also where you should go with any questions or
technical support requests. There are a lot of participating researchers
(over 800 at last count!) who may be able to help!

If you also want to receive updates about Lookit via email, please join the `lookit-research <https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/lookit-research>`__ list as well.


Overview: 15 minute to your first study!
----------------------------------------

1. Check to see if we already have an agreement with your institution to use the online testing platform (~1 minute) 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Approximately 100 institutions have already signed agreements.

a)	Check whether your institution is listed `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n3LKOIEStI4kYn0G4dXjaFmQ9B99RIg-8LvSMQRd6gw/edit?usp=sharing>`__

b) Send an email to Melissa (mekline@mit.edu) to be added to an existing agreement.

If your institution is not listed, the form you need is `here <https://github.com/lookit/research-resources/blob/master/Legal/Lookit%20Institutional%20Agreement.pdf>`__, and feel free to email Melissa for help.

2. Create a new researcher account (~1 minute)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Go `here <https://lookit.mit.edu/registration/>`__ to make a new researcher account. 

Please don't use a single login for your whole lab - even if you use a single email 
for lab communications (like mydevelopmentallab@gmail.com). Every person should have
their own account.

3. Create (~5 minutes) or join (~1 minute) your lab account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are the first user in your lab, go `here <https://lookit.mit.edu/registration/>`__ to 
create your own “lab” on the platform. 

You will use your lab to manage access to your group's studies. Every lab has its own public
page that shows the studies that are active right now. (Example:
https://lookit.mit.edu/studies/early-childhood-cognition-lab/)

If your lab already has an account, go 
to `this page <https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/labs/?page=1&set=all>`__, find your lab and click 
"Request to join".

4. Create a study (~10 minutes if you already have a study set up that you want to post)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To create a study, go `here <https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/studies/create>`__.  If you are posting 
a link to an existing study you have already set up, make sure to check the "External" checkbox. 
You can post a link directly to your unmoderated study (e.g. a Qualtrics page), or a link to a
scheduling page (e.g. Calendly) for live video chat studies.

Any studies you run will need to be approved by your institution's IRB (just like studies you 
run in person). If you do not already have permission to conduct online testing, you will need to 
amend your IRB protocol to include online testing (or submit a new protocol for your proposed 
online study.

If you are bringing study in progress to the platform, you can consider this an amendment to your 
recruiting method (comparable to a new social media ad). If you need approval to extend your 
recruiting methods please notify your institution's IRB of the amendment.

NB: The Lookit platform is run through MIT but MIT's IRB is not involved in any studies 
from other institutions.

If you do not yet have a study design and want to learn how to use the platform to create
studies (including asynchronous studies with no experimenter present that will collect webcam 
data of your participants) visit the :ref:`Lookit tutorial <tutorial>` to learn how 
the platform works.

5. What happens next?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

a) Go to your study page and choose Submit under the Study Status heading. Then send an email 
to Melissa (mekline@mit.edu) to let her know your study is ready to post. NB: you have to both
click submit and let Melissa know.

b) Within one business day, you will receive an email saying that your study is approved. (We
will contact you if for some reason your study is not yet ready for posting - e.g., because 
you are posting to an individual webpage with no university affiliation or without listing 
your IRB approval.)

c) After you've received the email saying your study is approved, go to your study page and hit 
“Start” under the Study Status heading. Be sure you are ready to start because your study will 
appear on the main study Children Helping Science page (and your lab's page) immediately. 
You can pause and re-start data collection whenever you need to.

6. Recruiting participants for your study
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Does the platform help advertise the study?**

Yes. As soon as you start data collection, emails advertising your study will start going 
out to a random subset of families eligible for your study in our >9,000+ family database. 
(Families decide if they want to be contacted at all and we limit the number of emails 
families receive so no one is overwhelmed with messages).

**Can I recruit participants directly to my study rather than the platform as a whole?**

Yes. You can ensure that any families you recruit go directly to your study page on the 
website by including a direct link to that study anywhere you advertise for participants.

**Do some studies have priority over others on the platform?**

No. The order in which studies appear on the Children Helping Science main page is randomized 
by individual user. Everyone - families and researchers - will see the same order every time 
they log on, making it easy for all of us to locate studies we have looked at before. However, 
every family and researcher will see their own randomly determined order.

**How do I benefit from others' recruitment efforts and how does recruiting for my study 
help others?**

Every lab's recruitment effort helps expand the participant pool for all of us. Families 
interested in participating in research are usually interested in many different studies. 
Thus, even if you are a first-time researcher setting up your first study and you haven't yet 
advertised at all, you are reaching roughly 9,000 families already interested in developmental 
science because other researchers have contributed to this community. Please join us!  

Even if you aren't currently recruiting for a study, you can help by promoting the platform 
broadly. Put a link to Children Helping Science on a parent-facing part of your lab or personal 
researcher website. This might look like this:
“Did you know that you can participate in our research from the comfort of
your own home? `Click here to check out Children Helping Science, an online platform
for developmental research. <https://lookit.mit.edu>`__ Families can
participate in our studies on their home computers, any time they want!”


Recommendations for your first online study
--------------------

If you are in the process of planning your first online study, here is an ordering of steps
we recommend that you take:

1. For internal studies, complete the :ref:`Lookit tutorial <tutorial>` to get familiar with how the platform 
   works and how to implement a study on it.

2. Figure out the details of how your study will work - counterbalancing, 
   practice trials, etc. Draft the parent-facing instructions, record any audio and video
   needed (e.g., verbal instructions, voiceover/questions, demos), and
   collect your stimuli. See :ref:`advice here <stim_prep>`.

3. Set up your study on Lookit and get it working just how you want it
   to! You’ll need to `set each of these
   fields <https://lookit.readthedocs.io/en/develop/researchers-set-study-fields.html>`__
   and write and test your study protocol.

4. Gather :ref:`peer feedback <peer review>` on your study to improve it; edit and 
   iterate.

5. Submit your study for :ref:`internal review <study_approval>`. Researchers are
   strongly encouraged to spend time polishing their studies as much as
   possible before submitting, including asking others to go through the
   study and provide feedback.

6. Once your study has successfully passed internal review, start data
   collection!

7. Put a link to the platform on a parent-facing part of your lab or personal
   researcher website. This might include something like this: “Did you
   know that you can participate in our research from the comfort of
   your own home? `Click here to check out Children Helping Science, an online platform
   for developmental research. <https://lookit.mit.edu>`__ Families can
   participate in our studies on their home computers, any time they
   want!”
