Getting started
=========================================================================================

If you're a researcher interested in using Lookit to run your own developmental studies, 
here's how you get started! 

.. admonition:: Do I have to do these in order?

   No! These steps can all be completed in parallel. Except for joining the Slack workspace, please do that first in case you have questions.

A. Join the Slack workspace!
----------------------------

Please `fill out this form <https://forms.gle/WVapAncBwRPR7pLX9>`__ for
an invite.

Slack is our primary means of communication about new features, best
practices, etc. It’s also where you should go with any questions or
technical support requests. There are a lot of participating researchers
(over 400 at last count!) who may be able to help!

If you also want to receive updates about Lookit via email, please join the
 `lookit-research <https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/lookit-research>`__ list as well.

B.  Set up your first study page
--------------------------------

There are three steps to create a study on Lookit:

1. Go to https://lookit.mit.edu/registration/ to make a new researcher account. Please *don't*
 use a single login for your whole lab - even if you use a single email for lab communications
 (like mydevelopmentallab@gmail.com), every person should have their own account.

2. If you are the first user in your lab, go to https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/labs/create/ to 
create your own “lab” on Lookit. You will use your lab to manage access to your group's 
studies, and every lab has its own public page that shows the studies that are active right 
now. (Here is the MIT ECCL lab's page: https://lookit.mit.edu/studies/early-childhood-cognition-lab/). 

If you want to join an existing labs, go to `this page <https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/labs/?page=1&set=all>`__, 
find your lab and click "Request to join".

3. Create your first study, by visiting https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/studies/create. 

If you want to post a link to an existing study you have already set up, make sure to check 
the "External" checkbox. You can post a link directly to your unmoderated study (e.g. a 
Qualtrics page), or a link to a scheduling page (e.g. Calendly) for live video chat studies.

If you want to build a new study that collects webcam data of your 
participants, visit the :ref:`Lookit tutorial <tutorial>` to learn how the platform works. 

C. Legal/logistical steps
-------------------------

Any studies you run will need to be approved by your own IRB (just like studies you run in 
person), but MIT's IRB is *not* involved in Lookit studies from other institutions. 

Before you can actually collect data from families on Lookit, your lab will
need to review the Terms of Use and sign a one-time institutional agreement with MIT. 
There are over 90 institutions that already have signed agreements - check whether yours is 
listed `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n3LKOIEStI4kYn0G4dXjaFmQ9B99RIg-8LvSMQRd6gw/edit?usp=sharing>`__,
and contact Melissa (mekline@mit.edu) to be added to an existing agreement. Check the
:ref:`IRB and legal information <legal>` page for the form you need to add a new institution, 
and for answers to questions that IRBs sometimes have about the platform. 

Launching a Lookit study
------------------------

Once you have done the steps above, your lab is ready to run Lookit studies! Depending on
whether you are bringing an existing online study to Lookit or creating a new one, 
the exact ordering of these steps might vary, but here is a step-by-step guide for 
setting up a new study:

1. Prepare all the details of how your study will work - counterbalancing, practice trials, 
etc. Draft the parent-facing instructions, record any audio and video needed (e.g., verbal 
instructions, voiceover/questions, demos), and design your stimuli. 

2. Edit your IRB protocol to include online testing, or submit a new protocol for your 
proposed online study. If you are bringing a study in progress to Lookit, it's probably
best to describe this as an amendment to your recruiting method (as you would for a 
new social media ad.)
   
3. (Internal studies only) Complete the :ref:`Lookit tutorial <tutorial>` to get familiar 
with how the platform works and how to implement your study, and see 
:ref:`advice here <stim_prep>` on preparing stimuli for online studies.

4. (All studies) Set up your study on Lookit and get it working just how you want it
to! You can find details on how to set each of your study fields (e.g. eligibility criteria)
on `this page <https://lookit.readthedocs.io/en/develop/researchers-set-study-fields.html>`__. 

5. Review your entire study process to make sure you are happy with how families will 
experience it, and remember that your online study is standing in for the entire lab visit,
from finding parking to debriefing the experiment and saying thank you. Here is `a checklist 
<https://lookit.readthedocs.io/en/develop/community-study-review-checklists-self.html>`__ 
you can use to think through some common issues for online studies. 

6. Gather :ref:`peer feedback <peer review>` on your study to improve it; edit and iterate.
Give peer review to studies from other labs - this is both the fair thing to do and a 
great way to pick up new strategies for your own studies!

7. Submit your study for :ref:`internal review <study_approval>`. *Note: Studies that were 
previously approved on ChildrenHelpingScience or which are already in the middle of data
collection will be automatically approved in most cases; make sure to ping Melissa on 
Slack when you submit your study!*

We aim to review all studies within 1-2 weeks, but for new studies you might need to go 
through more than one revise-and-resubmit to get approval to run your study. To minimize 
the chances of repeated revise-and-resubmits, researchers are strongly encouraged to spend 
time polishing their studies as much as possible before submitting, including asking 
others to go through the study and provide feedback.

8. Once your study has successfully passed internal review, start data collection! Your study
will appear on the main Lookit page and your lab's Lookit page, and invitations will start
going out to eligible families in our 8,000+ family database. You can pause and re-start 
data collection whenever you need to.

9. There are 8,000+ families in our database because of the work that other labs have done to 
advertise their specific studies - make sure to return the favor! You can ensure that any
families you recruit to Lookit take your study first by including a direct link that study -
the 'new user' workflow sends eligible participants right back to the study they came to take.

Put a link to Lookit on a parent-facing part of your lab or personal researcher website. 
This might include something like this: 

“Did you know that you can participate in our research from the comfort of your own home? 
`Click here to check out Lookit, an online platform for developmental research. <https://lookit.mit.edu>`__ 
Families can participate in our studies on their home computers, any time they want!”
