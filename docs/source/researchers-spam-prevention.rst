Preventing spam
==============================

Participants attempting to 'game the system' have been a reality of (adult) remote
research for years.  Children Helping Science has remained relatively free of
this issue because of (a) the higher barrier for participation - only families with
children are invited to participate, and families have to 
create an account before starting a study and (b) the stronger verification methods
we use - studies that use webcam video to analyze the central data also document that
a family with a child of roughly the expected age is present. 

As Lookit/CHS has grown, it has become a more attractive target for fake participants. 
The Children Helping Science strategy is that "totally fake participants" 
(e.g., someone who is participating in a child study without a child) should have 
a 0% success rate in receiving compensation. Importantly, even a low success rate 
(e.g., 5%) could encourage more fake participation, especially since the motivation 
for some people is not just profit but also just the challenge and satisfaction of
successfully hacking a system.

The CHS philosophy on scammers and bad-faith participation in studies
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Monitoring for potential fraud on CHS is a tricky balance, between preventing 
scammers from finding a foothold and maintaining a central value of the 
platform - creating a welcoming environment for families of all kinds, including 
those who don't already know the norms for participating in studies, and who 
may have a wide variety of technical challenges. By the numbers, confused 
families are significantly more common than scammer participants.

As an open community resource, Children Helping Science depends on researchers 
to do their part to maintain the high quality of both participant experiences and
research quality that we have enjoyed together over the past several years. 

.. admonition:: Your responsibility
   
   As researchers using CHS, it is your responsibility to treat participating 
   families with respect and an assumption of good faith, *and* to maintain 
   lab practices that are alert to the possibility of scammers and prevent 
   giving payments to people who are participating in bad faith.

The staff of Children Helping Science is working hard to contain the impact of
fake participants, whose behavior is sometimes most evident over multiple studies 
across multiple labs. Doing this depends on researchers following the steps described
on the rest of this page.
