Preventing spam
==============================

Participants attempting to 'game the system' have been a reality of (adult) remote
research for years.  Children Helping Science has remained relatively free of
this issue because of (a) the higher barrier for participation - only families with
children are invited to participate, and families have to 
create an account before starting a study and (b) the stronger verification methods
we use - studies that use webcam video to analyze the central data also document that
a family with a child of roughly the expected age is present. 

As Lookit/CHS has grown, it has become a more attractive target for fake participants. 
The Children Helping Science strategy is that "totally fake participants" 
(e.g., someone who is participating in a child study without a child) should have 
a 0% success rate in receiving compensation. Importantly, even a low success rate 
(e.g., 5%) could encourage more fake participation, especially since the motivation 
for some people is not just profit but also just the challenge and satisfaction of
successfully hacking a system.

We know that there are some types of fraud that are harder to detect, 
but we should have a 100% success rate for things like an adult doing studies 
without having any child at all. Likewise, participants who are participating in 
bad faith (not just confused) by doing things like creating multiple accounts, 
using the same child to stand in for multiple 'siblings' of different ages, etc. 
should have near-zero success, because a vigilant researcher community that is 
alert to these cases will tend to result in discovering and preventing more subtle 
kinds of bad behavior.

We recognize that this policy will require some researchers to amend their IRB 
protocols. However, we are confident this is the right policy because of 
(a) the broad benefits to the Lookit/CHS community overall in reducing fake 
participants, and (b) the direct benefits to the studies that are otherwise open 
to lots of fake participants without implementing video verification. You 
will be the biggest beneficiary of making sure your own studies are not full of fake data!

The CHS philosophy on scammers and bad-faith participation in studies
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Monitoring for potential fraud on CHS is a tricky balance, between preventing 
scammers from finding a foothold and maintaining a central value of the 
platform - creating a welcoming environment for families of all kinds, including 
those who don't already know the norms for participating in studies, and who 
may have a wide variety of technical challenges. By the numbers, confused 
families are significantly more common than scammer participants.

As an open community resource, Children Helping Science depends on researchers 
to do their part to maintain the high quality of both participant experiences and
research quality that we have enjoyed together over the past several years. 

.. admonition:: Your responsibility
   
   As researchers using CHS, it is your responsibility to treat participating 
   families with respect and an assumption of good faith, *and* to maintain 
   lab practices that are alert to the possibility of scammers and prevent 
   giving payments to people who are participating in bad faith.

The staff of Children Helping Science is working hard to contain the impact of
fake participants, whose behavior is sometimes most evident over multiple studies 
across multiple labs. Doing this depends on researchers following the steps described
on the rest of this page. 

Video verification for paid studies
------------------------------------

Beginning in December 2023, studies are required to implement a visual check that study participants are 
acting in good faith (i.e. that a child of the correct age is present and the family is 
attempting to participate in the study as designed) prior to compensating them. This policy 
applies to both internal and external studies. 

This is being required because we have experienced spam participants (e.g. people making 
many accounts and trying to get paid over and over again.) Our participant pool is 
extremely high quality, with the vast majority representing real families who are truthful
about their information and working hard to participate to the best of their abilities.

*Keeping* it this way by keeping bad-faith participants out of your datasets is a shared 
responsibility, and studies that don't screen their participants teach the scammers 
that they can get paid by lying about their information on CHS!

The goal of this requirement is to ensure independent confirmation that the family is
being basically truthful about their children's information, beyond just whatever they 
chose to input when creating their account. If you can't or don't want to use the procedures 
described below, you are very welcome to propose another method for verifying good-faith
participation! Please ask any questions you might have about this on `the Slack channel <https://forms.gle/WVapAncBwRPR7pLX9>`__.

Option 1: Don't pay participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Studies that don't provide monetary compensation to participants are exempt from 
this requirement. Many studies that offer a free 'thank you' such as a digital 
certificate or cute presentation of the child's data or video have been conducted 
successfully on CHS, so this is certainly an option to consider if your institution
has an absolute ban on collecting visual or other corroborating evidence about your
remote participants. 

Option 2: The standard Lookit video consent process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most straightforward way to meet this requirement, which the majority of studies
are already using currently, is to use the Lookit video consent form, which captures 
webcam video of the parent/guardian stating that they agree to participate in the 
study. In your compensation description, you can state that you require the child to 
be visible in the consent video, or you can use other video data that you 
collect during the session. 

For internal studies using the Lookit experiment builder, the video consent frame 
is likely already a standard part of your studies.  

If you are running an external, asynchronous
study (Bring-your-own Study Link), the easiest way to meet 
this requirement is to prepare a 'hybrid' study that uses the Lookit experiment 
builder to present the consent form, and then redirects to your external study.  
`Here is an example study template <https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/studies/3067/>`__ 
that you can copy and use. There is also the option to record video of the 
entire session by using `the iframe method <https://lookit.readthedocs.io/projects/frameplayer/en/develop/components/exp-lookit-iframe/doc.html>`__
to display your experiment in the same tab, without leaving the Children Helping Science
platform. 

Note that you can use this video consent method in place of or in addition to another
consent process (e.g. if your institution requires documenting consent on a specific platform.)

Option 3: Live video confirmation via Zoom or similar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For external, synchronous studies (Bring-your-own Meetings), the visual confirmation 
of the participating family and child during the video session satisfies this requirement.
As with all study types, you should be checking over the family's information for consistency
prior to releasing payment. 

If you are currently running an asynchronous study and don't want to use the video consent
process (Option 2), you could also arrange to have a quick zoom call with families *after*
they complete your study but *before* you release payment, for instance. 

Option 4: Propose something else
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We understand that the procedures we describe here may not work for every study, or may
require you to request a modification from your IRB. We encorage you to think about how
to frame this requirement to your IRB, because it may well be considered a small or 
negligible change from their perspective. For example, you could continue to use 
whatever consent process you have for your study as being the official consent 
from your IRBs perspective, while *also* having them do the video consent frame 
on Lookit/CHS (thus, you are not changing what counts as consent for your study, 
you are merely implementing a platform-required fraud-prevention step before
they even get to your study and the consent your study uses).

If you discover that none of the above
options is workable for you, we encourage you to think creatively about how else you
could meet the requirement to verify that your participants are who they say they are (or consider Option 1, volunteer participants.)
It may help to remind your IRB that other methods of identitiy verification (such as requiring a picture of a 
driver's license or a social media account) would constitute a *greater* risk to 
families, compared to short webcam video which does not reveal e.g. families'
full names or location information to the researcher. However, if something like the 
latter is what your IRB will approve, we're happy to talk about this option with you. 

Managing and reporting scam participants
-----------------------------------------

XXX START HERE

The first tool in your toolkit for managing scammers is a clear 
statement of when and how participants will be compensated.  The
compensation statement....

Your compensation information in the Lookit/CHS posting should likewise say something like “To be eligible for the gift card your child must be in the age range for this study, you need to submit a valid consent statement, and we need to see that there is a child with you during the study. Each child will only receive a gift card once for participating.”

## REVIEWING PARTICIPANTS FOR SCAMS 

Link to rogues gallery goes here. 
Include screenshot of consent video from MKS fake child. 

Here are the steps I recommend you take:* **DO NOT** pay for any of these sessions, or communicate further with these accounts.  I have already blocked them, but in the event they do contact you asking for payment, please forward anything to me.  
* Please **review** all of your sessions on the same experiment between August 15 and the present.  Red flags to look for based on the patterns we've seen include many children with identical birth dates (same or different year), more than one child per family (often normal, but I suggest checking the videos to ensure they are really two separate children), and short guardian or child nicknames like "cacs" or "noky"  
* Please **report** any new user global IDs back to this channel.  For my sanity and that of your fellow researchers, please first search this channel to see if an ID has been shared before  

## REPORTING SCAMS

- Join the spam slack channel
- Have a lab process that keeps you within the other rules 
- Ask on Slack about questions; be good about GUIDs 
- Use the report form

When you think you have identified a fake participant (or obvious violation of eligibility, or any other reason to deny compensation) you should report it via [this google form](https://forms.gle/SsMjfLQf5nqRNiALA). Someone from the CHS/Lookit core team will follow up with you within a few business days.

## (4) We will test researcher defense against fake participants with “white hat” attempts

  

Starting soon after the announcement of this policy, we will have [white hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)) attempts to get compensated for studies across Lookit/CHS. In other words, there will be a small amount of “fraudulent” activity on CHS that we are arranging.

  

Hopefully, all such white hat attempts are reported via the [google form](https://forms.gle/SsMjfLQf5nqRNiALA) to report fraudulent participation. 

  

If, on the other hand, you accidentally compensate a white hat attempt, we will of course return the compensation to you if reasonable (e.g., we can easily tell you to re-use a gift code you send; if you are doing something like mailing a children’s book then everyone might agree it is nicer to just donate it to a local charity rather than mailing it back). More importantly, accidentally compensating a white hat attempt will require a description of how you will be changing your procedures to be more resistant to fraud in the future, with confirmation from your lab’s PI that the plan is being implemented, and repeated compensation of white hat attempts may lead to the removal of your study from Lookit/CHS and the possibility that your lab may not be able to post new studies for a while.
