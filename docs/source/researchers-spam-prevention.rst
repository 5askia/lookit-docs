Preventing spam
==============================

Participants attempting to 'game the system' have been a reality of (adult) remote
research for years.  Children Helping Science has remained relatively free of
this issue because of (a) the higher barrier for participation - only families with
children are invited to participate, and families have to 
create an account before starting a study and (b) the stronger verification methods
we use - studies that use webcam video to analyze the central data also document that
a family with a child of roughly the expected age is present. 

As Lookit/CHS has grown, it has become a more attractive target for fake participants. 
The Children Helping Science strategy is that "totally fake participants" 
(e.g., someone who is participating in a child study without a child) should have 
a 0% success rate in receiving compensation. Importantly, even a low success rate 
(e.g., 5%) could encourage more fake participation, especially since the motivation 
for some people is not just profit but also just the challenge and satisfaction of
successfully hacking a system.

The CHS philosophy on scammers and bad-faith participation in studies
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Monitoring for potential fraud on CHS is a tricky balance, between preventing 
scammers from finding a foothold and maintaining a central value of the 
platform - creating a welcoming environment for families of all kinds, including 
those who don't already know the norms for participating in studies, and who 
may have a wide variety of technical challenges. By the numbers, confused 
families are significantly more common than scammer participants.

As an open community resource, Children Helping Science depends on researchers 
to do their part to maintain the high quality of both participant experiences and
research quality that we have enjoyed together over the past several years. 

.. admonition:: Your responsibility
   
   As researchers using CHS, it is your responsibility to treat participating 
   families with respect and an assumption of good faith, *and* to maintain 
   lab practices that are alert to the possibility of scammers and prevent 
   giving payments to people who are participating in bad faith.

The staff of Children Helping Science is working hard to contain the impact of
fake participants, whose behavior is sometimes most evident over multiple studies 
across multiple labs. Doing this depends on researchers following the steps described
on the rest of this page. 

Video verification for paid studies
------------------------------------

Beginning in December 2023, studies are required to implement a visual check that study participants are 
acting in good faith (i.e. that a child of the correct age is present and the family is 
attempting to participate in the study as designed) prior to compensating them. 

This is being required because we have experienced spam participants (e.g. people making 
many accounts and trying to get paid over and over again.) Our participant pool is 
extremely high quality, with the vast majority representing real families who are truthful
about their information and working hard to participate to the best of their abilities.

*Keeping* it this way by keeping bad-faith participants out of your datasets is a shared 
responsibility, and studies that don't screen their participants teach the scammers 
that they can get paid by lying about their information on CHS!

The goal of this requirement is to ensure independent confirmation that the family is
being basically truthful about their children's information, beyond just whatever they 
chose to input when creating their account. If you can't or don't want to use the procedures 
described below, you are very welcome to propose another method for verifying good-faith
participation! Please ask any questions you might have about this on `the Slack channel <https://forms.gle/WVapAncBwRPR7pLX9>`__.

Option 1: Don't pay participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most straightforward 
way to meet this requirement is to use the Lookit video consent form, and to require the 
child to be visible either in the consent video, or in other video data that you 
collect during the session. This can be in addition to or in place of the consent 
process that you are already using (e.g. if your institution requires a specific
consent form platform.)

Information for specific study types:

  - Bring-your-own Study Links: The easiest way to meet this requirement is to prepare a 'hybrid' study that
    uses the Lookit experiment builder to present the consent form, and then redirects to your external study.  `Here
    is an example study template <https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/studies/3067/>`__ that you can copy and use.
  - Bring-your-own Meetings: Visual confirmation of the participating family during the video session counts for this purpose.
  - Lookit Experiments: The video consent form is built into the design of the Lookit platform, and there are a number of tools
    that you can use for reviewing and tracking valid consent already available to researchers. This is covered in other parts of
    this documentation, and most example Lookit experiments include the consent process so you can see how it works.
