Spam prevention
==============================

Starting and stopping data collection and advertising
------------------------------------------------------

At any time, you can change either whether your study is active and whether it is discoverable.

Active vs. paused
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can start and stop data collection independently and whenever you
want. On your study detail page, go to “change state” -> “Start” or “Pause.”

When your study is active, participants can access it at the direct link shown on your study page. If the study is also discoverable, it will be listed on the Lookit "studies" page and advertised by email to eligible families.

When your study is paused, participants can't access it even if they have the direct link. If participants follow a direct link to your study and it is paused, they will see a message `like this <https://lookit.mit.edu/studies/c7001e3a-cfc5-4054-a8e0-0f5e520950ab/>`__.
